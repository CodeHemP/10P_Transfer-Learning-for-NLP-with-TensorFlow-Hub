# Transfer-Learning-for-NLP-with-TensorFlow-Hub

Transfer learning is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.

[TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/) is a repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.

## Objectives
In this project, we will use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub with [`tf.keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) for text classification. we will Use pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub Perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on real-world text data, build and evaluate multiple models for text classification with TensorFlow, and visualize model performance metrics with Tensorboard.
 

> __Prerequisites:__ Python programming language, be familiar with deep learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP), and have trained models with TensorFlow or and its Keras API.
